This directory contains task projects on the basic introduction to python programming language.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

**Task-0**: The [0-run](./0-run) file contains a Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`

**Task-1**: The [1-run_inline](./1-run_inline) file contains a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`

**Task-2**: The [2-print.py](./2-print.py) file contains a Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.

**Task-3**: The [3-print_number.py](./3-print_number.py) contains a program that prints the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.

**Task-4**: The [4-print_float.py](./4-print_float.py) contain a program that prints the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

**Task-5**: The [5-print_string.py](./5-print_string.py) file contains a program that prints 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.

**Task-6**: The [6-concat.py](./6-concat.py) file contains a script that prints `Welcome to Holberton School!`

**Task-7**: The [7-edges.py](./7-edges.py) file contains a script that print excluded characters of a given string.

**Task-8**: The [8-concat_edges.py](./8-concat_edges.py) file contains a script to to print `object-oriented programming with Python`, followed by a new line.

**Task-9**: The [9-easter_egg.py](./9-easter_egg.py) file contains a script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

**Task-10**: The [100-write.py](./100-write.py) file contains a Python script that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line without using the `print()` function.

**Task-11**: The [101-compile](./101-compile) file contains a script that compiles a Python script file.

**Task-12**: The [102-magic_calculation.py](./102-magic_calculation.py) is a script that contains the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b)`: that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:

```sh
	 3          0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)
              	    3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
                    6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
                    9 BINARY_POWER
                   10 BINARY_ADD
                   11 RETURN_VALUE
```
